\section{Capacity based deployment tool}
Several models have been published on how to calculate downlink electromagnetic field strengts. \ref{J1} describes on how to calculate the exposure for a single basestation.
The paper also describes on how to combine the different exposures for multiple basestations. 


- fitness functie, an algorithm was proposed to optimize either towards exposure of power consumption for a joint optimization of both values
- max possible exposure
- weighted average (but for each user instead of eatch grid point)
- exposure single bs
- combine exposure multiple bs
