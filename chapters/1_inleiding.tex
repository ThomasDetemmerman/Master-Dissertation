%	``If you think you've seen this movie before, you are right. Cloud computing is based on the time-sharing model we leveraged years ago before we could afford our own computers. The idea is to share computing power among many companies and people, thereby reducing the cost of that computing power to those who leverage it. The value of time share and the core value of cloud computing are pretty much the same, only the resources these days are much better and more cost effective.''

\section{Outline of the issue}
\label{sec:issue}

Society is constantly getting more and more dependent on electronic communication. On any given moment in any given location, an electronic device
can request to connect a bigger wireless medium. More devices need to be connected like IOT devices starting from small sensors up to self driving cars.

Once again it becomes clear why we're on the eve of new generation of cellular communication named 5G. 
This new technology is capable of handling millions of connections every square meter %to do: klopt deze hoeveelheid want lijkt wel heel veel.
while satisfying only a microsecond delay and a connection up to 10Gbps \cite{bioeffects}.

Also in exceptional and possibly life-threatening situations we rely on the cellular network. For example during the terrorist attacks in Zaventem, a Belgian city.
Mobile network operators saw all telecommunications drastically increasing causing moments of contention. Some operators decided to temporarily exceed the limited exposure in
order to handel all connections.. \cite{baseZaventem}

Electromagnetic exposure can however not be threaded lightly. Research show how electromagnetic radiation can cause diverse biological side effects. \cite{bio-effects}

\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}

In order to provide a network, even if the existing network is damaged, a deployment tool has been developed by the UGent. The idea is to 
attach femtocells to UAV's. Such a device is called a \gls{UABS}. The tool calculates where drones need to be positioned in order to connect an active user to the backbone network.
