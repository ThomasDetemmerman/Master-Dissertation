%	``If you think you've seen this movie before, you are right. Cloud computing is based on the time-sharing model we leveraged years ago before we could afford our own computers. The idea is to share computing power among many companies and people, thereby reducing the cost of that computing power to those who leverage it. The value of time share and the core value of cloud computing are pretty much the same, only the resources these days are much better and more cost effective.''

% PREDICTION AND COMPARISON OF DOWNLINK ELECTRICFIELDAND UPLINK LOCALISED SARVALUES FOR REALISTIC INDOORWIRELESS PLANNING
Society is constantly getting more and more dependent on electronic communication. On any given moment in any given location, an electronic device
can request to connect to a bigger wireless medium. Devices need more then ever to be connected starting from small IOT sensors up to self-driving cars.

Once again it becomes clear why we're on the eve of a new generation of cellular communication named 5G. 
This new technology is capable of handling millions of connections every square meter %to do: klopt deze hoeveelheid want lijkt wel heel veel.
while satisfying only a few microseconds of a delay and providing connections up to 10Gbps \cite{5GFeatures}.

Also in exceptional and possibly life-threatening situations, we rely on the cellular network. For example during the terrorist attacks in Zaventem, a Belgian city.
Mobile network operators saw all telecommunications drastically increasing causing moments of contention. Some operators decided to temporarily exceed the limited exposure in
order to handle all connections. \cite{baseZaventem}

Electromagnetic exposure can however not be neglected. Research shows how exesive electromagnetic radiation can cause diverse biological side effects \cite{bioeffects} and human exposure towards these electromagnetic waves should be limited. The \gls{ICNIRP} 
suggests a limitation of 61 V/m. Also on national levels restrictions have been enforced but differ from location to location. In Brussels for example is a far more restrictive limitation enforced of 6 V/m for all sources \cite{J1, J5}.
\section{Objective}
\label{sec:objective}
The general goal is to temporarily take over the wireless telecommunication network in the event of a disaster causing the normal network infrastructure to malfunction.


The deployment tool does not calculate the electromagnetic exposure of the different active users in the area.

\section{Structure}
\label{sec:structure}

The following chapter \ref{chap:stateoftheart} exists of several succesive sections explaining how the electromagnetic exposure of a single human being is calculated. The first section \ref{sec:calculatingexposure}
explains how the exposure is calculated between a user and a single femtocell. Section \ref{sec:combiningexposure}  defines how to combine all exposures from the different femtocells towards a single users.
Finaly, section \ref{sec:radiationpatterns} explains how directional antenna's are taken into account.
