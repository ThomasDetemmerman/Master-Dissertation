\textbf{Acknowledgement}
\end{center}

I would like to thank Prof. dr. ir. Wout Joseph, Prof. dr. ir. Luc Martens and Dr. ir. Margot Deruyck
for providing me access to the their capacity based deployment tool which allowed me to 
complete my research regarding electromagnetic exposure but  also for helping me map the road of my research.
Further I would like to express my gratitude to MPhil German Dario Castellanos Tache
who followed up my weekly progress by providing answers to  questions or problems I had and 
gave me extensive feedback and suggestions to the results I booked.
I would also like the show my deepest appreciation towards mrs. Carine Lambrecht and 
miss. Anke Blommaert for taking a second - and even a third - eye on the linguistic part of this document but also for the general 
mental support during this journey making this entire degree possible allowing me to stand where I am today.
